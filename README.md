# GoPro Motion Detector

I created this so i could set up my gopro as a motion detector camera, by streaming to this python file via rtmp using monaserver

I plan to make this into a mobile app where:
- The user activates a cloud hosted virtual machine running a mona server and this python file. 
- The IP of the mona server is then shared with the user.
- The user configures their GoPro to stream to that ip.
- When motion is detected, a notification is sent to the users phone
- When the user wants to stop streaming they do so via their phone
